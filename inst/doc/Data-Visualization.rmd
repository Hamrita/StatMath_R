## Programming Suggestion

- We will be using `ggplot2` to create our data visualizations.
- The code can get very long, so you should use code stacking!
- Stacking your code can help you troubleshoot and see what is going on easier. 

```{r eval = F}
textline +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "line", 
               aes(group = Group)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal,
               geom = "errorbar",
               width = .2) + 
  xlab("Measurement Time") +
  ylab("Mean Grammar Score") +
  cleanup +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Texting Option",
                     labels = c("All the texts", "None of the texts"),
                     values = c("Black", "Grey")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Baseline", "Six Months"))
```

## Outline

- Reminder how to import files
- Two key issues for data format: factors, format
- Graphs:
      
    - Histograms
    - Scatterplots
    - Bar Graphs
    - Line Graphs

## Working with Files

- Let's load SPSS file "ChickFlick.sav".
- Note that I have this saved in a `data` folder that is in the same folder as my Markdown file.
- Remember that the `rio` library can usually interpret these files without much work using the `import()` function. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rio)
chickflick <- import("data/ChickFlick.sav")
str(chickflick)
```

## Factor Categorical Variables

- We saw on the previous slide that the `gender` and `film` variables have embedded data from SPSS. 
- However, this does not translate to a factor variable, which is useful for making plots. 

```{r}
table(chickflick$gender)

table(chickflick$film)
```

## How to Factor
        
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chickflick$gender <- factor(chickflick$gender, #the variable you want to factor
                            levels = c(1,2), #the information already in the data
                            labels = c("Male", "Female")) #the labels for those levels

table(chickflick$gender)
```

## Data Structure Format

- **Wide** datasets: rows are *participants*, and columns are variables. 
  
    - Each participant gets one row, while each variable gets one column.

- **Long** datasets: rows are *assessments*, and columns are variables.

  - Each time point or repeated assessment gets a separate row, while each column still represents a variable. 
  

## Rearrange Data: Wide to Long

- I wanted to test the Disney philosophy that 'Wishing upon a star makes all your dreams come true'.
- Measured the success of 250 people using a composite measure involving their salary, quality of life and how close their life matches their aspirations.
- Success was measured using a standardized technique ranging from 0 Complete failure to 4 = Complete success
- Participants were randomly allocated to either: Wish upon a star or work as hard as they can for next 5 years.
- Success was measured again after 5 years.

```{r}
library(reshape) #note: you could also use pivot_longer in tidyverse
cricket <- import("data/Jiminy_Cricket.csv")
head(cricket)
```

## Rearrange Data: Wide to Long

- `id = c("column", "column")` - constant variables you do not want to change. These will stay their own column but get repeated when necessary.
- `measured = c("column", "column")` - dependent variables you want to combine into one column.

```{r}
longcricket <- melt(cricket,  #name of dataset
                    id = c("ID", "Strategy"), 
                    measured = c("Success_Pre", "Success_Post"))
#you can actually leave measured blank
head(longcricket)
```

## Rearrange Data: Wide to Long

- Unfortunately, our melted columns become `variable` and `value`, which are not very useful names.
- We should rename them for clarity!

```{r}
colnames(longcricket)[3:4] #just to figure out which ones
colnames(longcricket)[3:4] <- c("Time", "Score")
```

## The Art of Presenting Data

- Graphs should (Tufte, 2001):

    - Show the data.
    - Induce the reader to think about the data being presented (rather than some other aspect of the graph).
    - Avoid distorting the data.
    - Present many numbers with minimum ink.
    - Make large data sets (assuming you have one) coherent.
    - Encourage the reader to compare different pieces of data.
    - Reveal data.

## Why is this Graph Bad?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="35%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/graphs/badgraph.png")
```

## Other Bad Design Choices

- 3D charts need to be well-made (check out `plotly`). 
- Patterns *(depending)*
- Cylindrical bars
- Bad axis labels
- Overlays

## Why is this Graph Better?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="35%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/graphs/bettergraph.png")
```

## Do Not Deceive the Reader!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/graphs/deception.png")
```

## Plotting in R

- The great thing about `ggplot2` is that it is very flexible and well documented!
- The bad thing about `ggplot2` is that there's a lot going on. 
- You may also need `Hmisc` for your error bars. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Working with ggplot2

- How ggplot works: First you define the basic structure of a plot you want.

```{r eval = F}
#an example 
myGraph <- ggplot(dataset,
                  aes(x_axis, y_axis, 
                      color = legend_var, 
                      fill = legend_var))
```

## Working with ggplot2

- Now we have myGraph saved with all the variables, but no visualization.
- Next, you can add options to create new layers on the graph.

```{r eval = F}
#an example part 2
myGraph + 
  geom_bar() +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("X Axis Label") + 
  ylab("Y Axis Label")
```

## Histograms

- Histograms plot:

    - The continuous score (x-axis)
    - The frequency (y-axis)

- Histograms help us to identify:

    - The shape of the distribution. Measured using **Skew, Kurtosis, or the Spread or variation in scores.**
                 
- Unusual scores

## Histogram: Example 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crickethist <- ggplot(data = cricket, #dataset
                      aes(x = Success_Pre) #only define X axis 
                      )
crickethist
```

## Histogram: Example

- Our current plot is blank, let's add the histogram bars:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crickethist + 
  geom_histogram()
```

## Histogram: Example

- Make the bins different:

```{r echo=TRUE,  fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crickethist + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

## Histogram: Example

- You can change the color:
  
    - Color is the outline of the bars
    - Fill is the interior of the bars 

```{r echo=TRUE,  fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crickethist + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'purple', fill = 'magenta')
```

## Histogram: Example

- Let's add some labels:

```{r echo=TRUE,  fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crickethist + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'purple', fill = 'magenta') + 
  xlab("Success Pre Test") + 
  ylab("Frequency")
```

## Histogram: Example 2

- This dataset includes festival attendees who indicated their hygiene score on each day of the festival from  0 (eau de toilet) to 4 (eau de toilette) 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
festival <- import("data/festival.csv")
str(festival)
```

## Histogram: Example 2

- In the previous example, we added things one at a time just as an example
- You can run the whole graph at once! 

- Create the plot object:

```{r echo=TRUE,  fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
festivalhist <- ggplot(data = festival, aes(x = day1)) 
festivalhist + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'blue') + 
  xlab("Day 1 of Festival Hygiene") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  theme_bw() #theme_classic() also good!
```

## Focus on these Facets

- All graphs should have:

    - X and Y axis labels.
    - The use of titles depends on where the graph is used.
    - Labels for the legend, facets, other group markers.
    - Error bars when appropriate.
    - Readable/cleaned up!

## Clean Up?

- `theme_bw()` and `theme_classic()` are great, easy themes to make graphs presentable.
- Another important facet may be the font size, as it appears to be pretty small on the default.
- Additionally, we will want to eliminate that default gray background that is included with legends. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cleanup <- theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), #no grid lines
                panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), #no grid lines
                panel.background = element_blank(), #no background
                axis.line.x = element_line(color = 'black'), #black x axis line
                axis.line.y = element_line(color = 'black'), #black y axis line
                legend.key = element_rect(fill = 'white'), #no legend background
                text = element_text(size = 15)) #bigger text size
```

## Clean Up?

- Save that code and then you can just do graph + cleanup.

```{r echo=TRUE,  fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
festivalhist + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = 'blue') + 
  xlab("Day 1 of Festival Hygiene") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  cleanup
```

## Scatterplots

- Simple scatter: X and Y are continuous variables
- Grouped scatter: X and Y are continuous variables with legend for a third variable (generally categorical).

## Scatterplots: Example

- Anxiety and Exam Performance: 103 students who rated their exam anxiety, time spent revising their exam, exam performance, and gender. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
exam <- import("data/Exam_Anxiety.csv")
str(exam)
```

## Scatterplots: Example

- Gender is currently a continuous variable, so we should factor that variable to appropriately label it on a graph when used. 

```{r}
table(exam$Gender)
exam$Gender <- factor(exam$Gender,
                     levels = c(1,2),
                     labels = c("Male", "Female"))
table(exam$Gender)
```

## Simple Scatterplot

```{r echo=TRUE,  fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
scatter <- ggplot(exam, aes(Anxiety, Exam))
scatter +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Anxiety Score") +
  ylab("Exam Score") +
  cleanup
```

## Simple Scatterplot with Regression Line

```{r echo=TRUE,  fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
scatter + geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'black', fill = 'blue') +
  xlab('Anxiety Score')+
  ylab('Exam Score')+
  cleanup
```

## Grouped Scatterplot

- How to control the colors and fill with legends.

    - scale_fill_manual(name, labels, values)
    - scale_color_manual(name, labels, values)

## Grouped Scatterplot with Regression Line

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
scatter2 <- ggplot(exam, aes(Anxiety, Exam, 
                             color = Gender, fill = Gender)) #why both?
scatter2 +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlab("Anxiety Score") +
  ylab("Exam Score") +
  cleanup + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Gender of Participant",
                    labels = c("Men", "Women"),
                    values = c("purple", "grey")) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Gender of Participant",
                     labels = c("Men", "Women"),
                     values = c("purple", "grey10"))

```

## `GGally` for Multiple Visualization

- `GGally` has a plotting function that uses `ggplot2` as a back end. 
- The function `ggpairs` allows you to create a scatterplot matrix for any numerical variables in a dataset. 

```{r}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(data = exam[ , -1], #no participant variable
        title = "Exam Anxiety, Scores, and Gender")
```

## Bar Graphs 

- Bar graphs are often used to display mean scores to allow comparison between groups.
- Error bars can be added to display the precision of the mean:
    
    - The confidence interval 
    - The standard deviation
    - The standard error 

## Bar Graph: One Independent Variable

- Is there such a thing as a 'chick flick'? 

    - Twenty men and twenty women were assigned to watch one of two movies:  A 'chick flick' (Bridget Jones's Diary) or the control movie (Memento).
    - Physiological arousal was used as an indicator of how much they enjoyed the film.

## Bar Chart: One Independent Variable

- Be sure to convert all factor variables, otherwise they will be treated as continuous (or you'll get strange errors!).

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str(chickflick) #already fixed gender
chickflick$film <- factor(chickflick$film,
                    levels = c(1,2),
                    labels = c("Bridget Jones", "Memento"))
```

## Bar Chart: One Independent Variable Example

- To add the mean, displayed as bars, we can add this as a layer to bar using the  `stat_summary()` function:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chickbar <- ggplot(chickflick, aes(film, arousal))
chickbar + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "bar",
               fill = "White", 
               color = "Black") +
  cleanup
```

## Bar Chart: One Independent Variable Example

- To add error bars, add these as a layer using `stat_summary()`:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chickbar + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "bar",
               fill = "White", 
               color = "Black") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, 
               geom = "errorbar", 
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.90), 
               width = 0.2) +
  cleanup
```

## Bar Chart: One Independent Variable Example

- Now, add the rest of things we've been doing:

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chickbar + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "bar",
               fill = "White", 
               color = "Black") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, 
               geom = "errorbar", 
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.90), 
               width = 0.2) +
  xlab("Movie Watched by Participant") +
  ylab("Arousal Level") +
  cleanup +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Girl Film", "Guy Film"))

```

## Bar Chart: Two Independent Variables

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chickbar2 <- ggplot(chickflick, aes(film, arousal, fill = gender))
chickbar2 +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean,
               geom = "bar",
               position = "dodge") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal,
               geom = "errorbar", 
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.90),
               width = .2) +
  xlab("Film Watched") +
  ylab("Arousal Level") + 
  cleanup +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Gender of Participant", 
                    labels = c("Boys", "Girls"),
                    values = c("Gray30", "Gray"))
```

## Line Graphs

- When to use a line graph:

    - With data that X is categorical, but is considered "mildly continuous"
    - Usually with repeated measures data over time 
    - The example here is not quite appropriate for a line graph but does include repeated measures data for practicing restructuring data. 
    
## Line Graphs: One Independent Variable

- How to cure hiccups? Participants included 15 participants who tried four hiccup cures. 
- The dependent variable included the number of hiccups in the minute after each procedure.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hiccups <- import("data/Hiccups.csv")
str(hiccups)
```

## Line Graphs: One Independent Variable

- These data are in the wrong format for `ggplot2` to use. 
- We need all of the scores stacked up in a single column and then another variable that specifies the type of intervention.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
longhiccups <- melt(hiccups, 
                    measured = c("Baseline", "Tongue", "Carotid", "Other"))
str(longhiccups)
colnames(longhiccups) <- c("Intervention", "Hiccups")
```

## Line Graphs: One Independent Variable

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hiccupline <- ggplot(longhiccups, aes(Intervention, Hiccups))
hiccupline +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, ##adds the points
               geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, ##adds the line
               geom = "line",
               aes(group=1)) + ##necessary for mapping line to dots
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, ##adds the error bars
               geom = "errorbar", 
               width = .2) +
  xlab("Intervention Type") +
  ylab("Number of Hiccups") + 
  cleanup
```

## Line Graphs: Two Independent Variables

- Is text-messaging bad for your grammar? Participants included 50 children who were split into two groups (between-subjects): text-messaging allowed or text-messaging forbidden. 
- In a second variable (repeated measures), each child was measured at two points in time: at baseline and six months later. 
- The dependent variable was the percent correct score on a grammar test.

## Line Graphs: Two Independent Variables

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
texting <- import("data/Texting.xlsx")
str(texting)
```

## Line Graphs: Two Independent Variables

- Two issues to clean up: 
    
    - Correctly label the groups into a factor variable.
    - Restructure the data so the repeated measures variable is in long format.
    - When you restructure the data, you should also rename the columns 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
texting$Group <- factor(texting$Group,
                       levels = c(1,2),
                       labels = c("Texting Allowed", "No Texting Allowed"))
longtexting <- melt(texting,
                   id = c("Group"),
                   measured = c("Baseline", "Six_months"))
str(longtexting)
colnames(longtexting) <- c("Group", "Time", "Grammar_Score")
```

## Line Graphs: Two Independent Variables

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
textline <- ggplot(longtexting, aes(Time, Grammar_Score, color = Group))
textline +
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "line", 
               aes(group = Group)) + #Group is the variable name
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal,
               geom = "errorbar",
               width = .2) + 
  xlab("Measurement Time") +
  ylab("Mean Grammar Score") +
  cleanup +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Texting Option",
                     labels = c("All the texts", "None of the texts"),
                     values = c("Black", "Grey")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Baseline", "Six Months"))
```
