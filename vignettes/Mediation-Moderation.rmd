##  What is Mediation?

- Refers to a situation when the relationship between a predictor variable and outcome variable can be explained by their relationship to a third variable (the mediator).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='left'}

```

## Baron & Kenny (1986)

- **Mediation** is tested through three regression models:

    - Predicting the outcome from the predictor variable.
    - Predicting the mediator from the predictor variable. 
    - Predicting the outcome from both the predictor variable and the mediator. 

## Baron & Kenny (1986)

- **Four conditions of mediation:**

    - The predictor must significantly predict the outcome variable.*
    - The predictor must significantly predict the mediator.
    - The mediator must significantly predict the outcome variable.
    - The predictor variable must predict the outcome variable less strongly in model 3 than in model 1.

## Baron & Kenny (1986): Limitations

- How much of a reduction in the relationship between the predictor and outcome is necessary to infer mediation? 
- People tend to look for a change in significance, which can lead to the 'all or nothing' thinking that p-values encourage. 
- Two solutions:
  
    - The Sobel test
    - Bootstrapping the indirect effect and confidence intervals 
    
## Sobel Test

- An alternative is to estimate the indirect effect and its significance using the Sobel test (Sobel, 1982). 
- If the Sobel test is significant, there is significant mediation
- We are going to use the Aroian Test version of Sobel which corrects for the standard error of the a and b paths.
    
## Bootstrapping

- **What is bootstrapping?**

    - A procedure where you run an analysis many times to create an average effect and confidence interval of the effect. 
    - Bootstrapped datasets are created by randomly picking a sample from your dataset with replacement
    - Think about this like the lottery, if they put the balls back.
    - If the confidence interval of the indirect (mediation) effect does not cross zero, then that implies that mediation has occurred. 

## Mediation: Data Screening

- Mediation models usually occur in stages - meaning separate models are run with different IV / DV combinations. 
- Sometimes people call these "steps", but do not confuse this with hierarchical regression. 
- So, what does that do for data screening?

    - Screen both the IV and the Mediator at the same time predicting the DV.
    - This way you are screening the final anticipated stage of the mediation model and are screening all the variables. 
    - You can also use the fake regression procedure to do all three variables at once. 

## Mediation: Example

- Does Facebook use mediate the relationship between previous knowledge and exam scores?
- Implying that the overuse of Facebook prevents people from studying, so they do differently on their exam? 
- Important not to have missing data, so you are comparing models that all use the same data points. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rio)
master <- import("data/mediation.sav")
str(master)

summary(master)
master <- na.omit(master)
```

## Mediation: c Path

- The c path: X --> Y: $$b = 0.32, t(237) = 3.63, p < .001$$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(exam ~ previous, data = master)
summary(model1)
```

## Mediation: a Path

- The a path: X --> M: $$b = -0.09, t(237) = -2.17, p = .031$$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model2 <- lm(facebook ~ previous, data = master)
summary(model2)
```

## Mediation: b, c' Path

- Add in the b and c' paths: X + M --> Y
- b Path: $$b = -0.61, t(237) = -4.77, p < .001$$ 
- c' Path: $$b = 0.26, t(237) = 3.09, p = .002$$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model3 <- lm(exam ~ previous + facebook, data = master)
summary(model3)
```

## Mediation: Interpretation

- Previous experience positively impacts exam scores (c path = 0.32).
- Previous experience negatively impacts Facebook time (a path = -0.09).
- Controlling for previous experience, Facebook time negatively impacts exam scores (b path = -0.61).
- Controlling for Facebook scores, previous experience positively impacts exam scores (c' path = 0.26).
- So, did mediation happen? Is a change from 0.31 to 0.26 important?

## Mediation: Sobel Test

- The Aroian Test: $Z = \frac{a \times b}{\sqrt{b^2 \times SD_a^2 + a^2 \times SD_b^2 + SD_a^2 \times SD_b^2}}$
- If the indirect effect is larger than the error, we would conclude that the addition of the M variable changed the c path. 

    - Fill in the correct coefficient numbers
    - Note if you use this code provided and fill in X and M in the correct order, you will not need to change the Sobel code.
    
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#aroian sobel
a <- coef(model2)[2]
b <- coef(model3)[3]
SEa <- summary(model2)$coefficients[2,2]
SEb <- summary(model3)$coefficients[3,2]
zscore <- (a*b)/(sqrt((b^2*SEa^2)+(a^2*SEb^2)+(SEa^2*SEb^2)))
zscore
#two tailed test 
pnorm(abs(zscore), lower.tail = F)*2
```

## Mediation: Sobel Test

- Z = 1.93, p = .053
- We would conclude that no mediation had occurred.

## Mediation: All Together + Bootstrapping

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("doomlab/MeMoBootR")
library(MeMoBootR)

#no missing data allowed
med_results <- mediation1(y = "exam",
                          x = "previous", 
                          m = "facebook", 
                          df = master)
```

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

- The MeMoBootR package gives you data screening, each step of the mediation, and the bootstrapping results!
- The data screening does not include accuracy or missing data, so that should be completed first. 

```{r}
head(med_results$datascreening$fulldata)
med_results$datascreening$correl
med_results$datascreening$linearity
med_results$datascreening$normality
med_results$datascreening$homogen
```

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

- For each of our stages of mediation, you can print out the models:

```{r}
summary(med_results$model1)
summary(med_results$model2)
summary(med_results$model3)
```

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

- Next, you can get the Sobel test results:

```{r}
med_results$indirect.effect
med_results$z.score
med_results$p.value
```

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

- Last, let's get the bootstrapped results: 

  - The indirect effect would be reported as: $0.06, 95\% CI[-0.01, 0.12]$

```{r}
med_results$boot.results
med_results$boot.ci
med_results$diagram
```

## Moderation

- The combined effect of two variables on another is known conceptually as **moderation**, and in statistical terms as an **interaction effect**.

- Do violent video games make people aggressive? 

    - DV: Aggression
    - IV:
    
        - Callous unemotional traits 
        - Number of hours spent playing video games per week
        - Interaction

## Conceptual Moderation Model

- If callous-unemotional traits were a moderator then we're saying that the strength or direction of the relationship between game playing and aggression depends on the strength of callous-unemotional traits.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/medmod/4.png")
```

## Conceptual Moderation Model

- If the X variable was categorical, you are basically checking if the separate groups (levels) have different slopes for the non-categorical variable. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/medmod/5.png")
```

## Conceptual Moderation Model

- However, if X is continuous, we have to find a new way to figure out the shape of the interaction.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/medmod/6.png")
```

## Statistical Moderation Model

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/medmod/7.png")
```

## Centering variables

- The interaction term makes the *b*s for the main predictors uninterpretable in many situations.
- Centering refers to the process of transforming a variable into deviations around a fixed point.
- Centering solves two problems: 

    - Interpretation
    - Multicollinearity
    
## Centering variables

- Easiest way to center to make them useful:

    - Score - Mean for that variable.
    - What does that do?
    
- Centered variables for main effects have two interpretations

    - Effect of that predictor at the mean value for the sample
    - Average effect of the predictor across a range of scores for the other predictor 
    
## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- If the interaction is significant, then you usually ignore the main effects (each variable by itself).
- So what do I do if my interaction is significant? **A simple slope analysis**
- If variables are categorical, then you are simply looking at the differences across one variable or another 

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- For continuous variables, you "create" low, average, and high groups.

    - Low groups are people who are one SD below the mean
    - Average groups are people are at the mean
    - High groups are people who are one SD above the mean 
    - However, creating groups is backwards from what you think. 

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- We are examining the interaction between hours of video games and unemotional traits to predict aggression
- Think about which variable you want to know the differences in (i.e., low, average, high).
- So at different levels of callousness, we want to examine the relationship between hours of video games and aggression.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
master <- import("data/moderation.sav")
str(master)
```
    
## Moderation: Centering

- Center your variables using scale()

    - Using scale = F turns off dividing by SD, which would create z-scores.
    - You can use z-score centering if you wanted the coefficients to be beta. It is likely easier to interpret the b values though. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#center the X and M variable (NOT THE DV)
#when you create these use the final dataset 
master$zvid = scale(master$Vid_Games, scale = F) #mean center, not z score
master$zcal = scale(master$CaUnTs, scale = F)
```

## Moderation: Running

- For data screening, we would screen the model with the interaction, and all other considerations are the same as regression.
- Run the model:

    - You do not have to create an interaction column, to multiply does that automatically for you.
    - Also includes the main effects of each variable by itself. 
    
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#run the model to see if the moderation is significant
#use the z score variables!
#be sure to do X*M so the graph is right 
modmodel <- lm(Aggression ~ zvid*zcal, data = master)
```

## Moderation: Interpretation 

- Overall model is significant, $F(3, 438) = 88.46, p < .001, R^2 = .38$
- Interaction effect is significant, $b = 0.03, t(438) = 3.88, p < .001$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(modmodel)
```

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- So, how do we create groups when we have a continuous variable?

    - Most people look at "low" as one SD below the mean and "high" as one SD above the mean.
    - Lots of combinations are possible though. 

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- Create the low and high versions of the M variable (callousness in this example)

    - Low created by ADDING a SD
    - High created by SUBTRACTING a SD
    - The rule is that we have to bring them to the middle because we centered so that zero is the middle

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#create the low and high z score variables 
master$zcallow <- master$zcal + sd(master$zcal) #bring them up
master$zcalhigh <- master$zcal - sd(master$zcal) #bring them down
summary(master)
```

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- Then run the model with the new low and high versions of the variable. 
- What do I do with that?
- You look at the other variable because the coefficients for M and X*M will not change. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#run the models
#be sure to X*M
modmodellow <- lm(Aggression ~ zvid*zcallow, data = master)
modmodelhigh <- lm(Aggression ~ zvid*zcalhigh, data = master)

```

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- At low levels of callousness, video game hours is unrelated to aggression, b = -0.09 ...

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(modmodellow) #low slope
```

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- At average levels of callousness, hours of video games predicts increasing aggression, b = 0.17 ...

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(modmodel) #average slope
```

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- At high levels of callousness, the strength of hours of video games predicting aggression is the strongest, b = 0.43 ... 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(modmodelhigh) #high slope
```

## Moderation: Simple Slopes

- Significant interactions will create fan effects of slopes that either get stronger/weaker in strength or switch directions. 
- Here, we find that increasing levels of callousness leads to increasing effects of video game time on aggression. 

## Moderation: Graphing

- We can use the ggplot to create a graph of the moderation effect.
- But we are going to manually draw the lines on a scatterplot graph. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
cleanup <- theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
                panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
                panel.background = element_blank(), 
                axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black"),
                axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black"),
                legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white"),
                text = element_text(size = 15))

modgraph <- ggplot(master, aes(zvid, Aggression))

##change Cal to the new moderator label
##change xlab for the new X label
modgraph + 
  xlab("Centered Video Games") + 
  geom_point(color = "gray") +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = modmodellow$coefficients[1],
                  slope = modmodellow$coefficients[2], 
                  linetype = "-1SD Cal"), size = 1) +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = modmodel$coefficients[1],
                  slope = modmodel$coefficients[2], 
                  linetype = "Average Cal"), size = 1) +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = modmodelhigh$coefficients[1],
                  slope = modmodelhigh$coefficients[2], 
                  linetype = "+1SD Cal"), size = 1) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c("dotted", "dashed", "solid"),
                        breaks = c("-1SD Cal", "Average Cal", "+1SD Cal"),
                        name = "Simple Slope") +
  cleanup 
```

## Moderation: MeMoBootR

- We can use the `MeMoBootR` to complete the entire processing, including data screening for us! 
- You would enter the raw variables, as the centering is completed for you. 

```{r}
mod_model <- moderation1(y = "Aggression",
                         x = "Vid_Games",
                         m = "CaUnTs",
                         df = master)
```

## Moderation: MeMoBootR

```{r}
#data screening

#mod_model$datascreening$correl
