## Data Screening

- **Garbage in, garbage out:**

    - Data screening is a key facet of any analysis.
    - Data that is incorrect will produce useless output.
    - Data screening ensures the results are interpretable. 

- **Our check should include for:**

    - Accuracy,
    - Missing data, 
    - Outliers, and
    - Assumptions.

- Note that **assumptions checks may depend on the type** of test because there are **different tests.**

## An Important Note

- **Normally our $\alpha$ value is set to < 0.05, other-wise known as a Type 1 Error.**

    - Therefore, we use p < .05 as a criterion for statistical significance.

- **In data screening, we want to use a stricter criterion.**

    - Therefore, we are going to use p < .001 to denote problematic issues.  

## What Order Should be followed?

- (1) Accuracy Check,
- (2) Missing Data Check, 
- (3) Outliers Check, and 
- (4) Assumptions for the analysis performed. 

- **Assumptions include:**

    - Additivity
    - Normality 
    - Linearity 
    - Homogeneity
    - Homoscedasticity

## Why is this the order?

- If you correct errors - they may become missing data points.
- If you replace missing data - they may become outliers.
- If you exclude outliers, this may change assumption interpretations.
- Therefore: each step can potentially affect the next steps.

## Data Screening Example

- While we have not covered any specific analyses yet, we can screen data overall that will cover many different types of analyses. 
- This dataset examines the resiliency (RS columns) of teenagers after a natural disaster.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rio)
master <- import("data/data_screening.csv")
str(master)
```

## Accuracy

- We will want to check for several issues:
  
    - Any factor variables incorrectly imported as numbers.
    - Any reverse coded variables. 
    - Any out of range values or incorrect values.
    - Other errors depending on data collection procedure.

## Accuracy: Categorical Variables

```{r}
notypos <- master #update the dataset with each step 
apply(notypos[ , c("Sex", "SES")], 2, table)
#3 here for sex is probably incorrect
```

## Accuracy: Categorical Variables

- We can use `factor()` but not include the bad label to drop that incorrect point.
- You can also exclude it as shown in a few slides. 

```{r}
## fix the categorical labels and typos
notypos$Sex <- factor(notypos$Sex, 
                     levels = c(1,2), #no 3
                     labels = c("Women", "Men"))
notypos$SES <- factor(notypos$SES, 
                     levels = c(1,2, 3),
                     labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
apply(notypos[ , c("Sex", "SES")], 2, table)
```

## Accuracy: Continuous Variables

- We can use the `summary()` function to view the summary statistics for our continuous variables.
- Useful to check the min and max for out of range values.
- Useful to check for reverse scoring (for data you know well, the mean may be obvious it is much lower than the rest). 
- The RS14 scale runs from 1 to 7, so we clearly have some typos. 

```{r}
summary(notypos)
```

## How do we "fix" issues? 

- Find the original data and **figure out what the point should be**.
- **Delete that data point** but not the entire participant.

## Accuracy: Continuous Variables 

- When you have an inaccurate value in one or only a few columns, you can fix those values using logical operators that we discussed in our subsetting section. 
- In this example, we know that students could not have missed more than 15 days. 

```{r}
summary(notypos$Grade)
notypos$Grade[ notypos$Grade > 15 ] <- NA
summary(notypos$Grade)
```

## Accuracy: Continuous Variables 

- When you have inaccurate values for columns that all have the same possible range, you can use the subsetting rules across all columns at once. 

```{r}
names(notypos)
head(notypos[ , 6:19]) #lots of ways to do this part!
notypos[ , 6:19][ notypos[ , 6:19] > 7 ] <- NA
summary(notypos)
```

## Accuracy: Continuous Variables

- Using mean and standard deviation to interpret accuracy for continuous variables
- You want to make sure it's the **data you expect, the mean can be used to make such a judgment.**

- Also, **standard deviation indicates the spread of the data**

    - very large spreads (lots of error) and,
    - very small spreads (no variance) can be bad for you.
    - Remember that depends on the scale of the data.

## Accuracy: Continuous Variables

```{r}
names(notypos)
apply(notypos[ , -c(1,3)], 2, mean, na.rm = T)
apply(notypos[ , -c(1,3)], 2, sd, na.rm = T)
```

## Missing Data

- To check for **missing data**, `summary()` can give a quick view. 
- Additionally, we can continue to use `apply()` for a sum of the number of `NA` values.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(notypos)
apply(notypos, 2, function(x) { sum(is.na(x)) })
```

## Missing Data

- Missing data is an important problem and leads us to ask ourselves one question: **Why is this data missing?**
    
    - Did someone skip the question?
    - Did someone forget to enter it (from a paper survey or other transfer of data)?
    - Is it a typo or other issue with answering the question appropriately? 

## Types of Missing Data

- **MCAR:** missing completely at random 
    
    - You want this type of missing data.
    - Potentially, participants simply skipped a question or missing a trial. 
    
- **MNAR:** missing not at random.

    - This type of missing data can be problematic.
    - May be the survey instrument, computer program, or other data collection issue. 
    - For instance, what if you surveyed a campus about alcohol abuse? What does it mean if everyone skips the same question?

- There are ways to test for the type, but most times you can easily note problematic **MNAR** data by checking percent of missing data or using the `View()` function.

## What do I do with missing data?

- You should not replace:
    
    - **MNAR** data 
    - Categorical options that are demographic of the participants

- You can conservatively replace:

    - **MCAR** data when 5% of the data or less is to be replaced
    - Be careful with small datasets 
    
- **Note:** there is a difference between *missing data* and *incomplete data*. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/datascreen/missing.png")
```

## What do I do with missing data?

- By creating different datasets at each stage of our screening, we can run our analyses with and without missing data replaced to determine if our replacement impacted our results. 
- We can exclude entire participants (listwise) with missing data or only when they have have missing data for that analysis (pairwise). 

## What do I do with missing data?

- There are multiple estimation methods to "fill-in" missing data if you did not want to remove it. 
- Mean substitution was a popular way to estimate missing data by simply estimating the mean for that variable for the missing data points.
    
    - Conservative - doesn't change the mean values used to find significant differences.
    - Does change the variance, which may cause type I error with a large number of estimated data points.

- Multiple imputation is now the most popular way to estimate missing data points because computing programs have made this process easier. 

    - Creates a set of potential expected values for each missing point. 
    - Using matrix algebra, the program estimates the probably of each value and picks the highest one. 

## Visualize Missing Data

```{r}
library(VIM, quietly = T)
aggr(notypos, numbers = T)
```

## Replacing Missing Data: Rows

- We will start with examining missing data by rows, as we can exclude incomplete data and rows with too much missing data to replace. 
- This table tells us a summary of the missing data - how much is missing in the top row and the number of rows with that missing data in the second row of the table. 

```{r}
percentmiss <- function(x){ sum(is.na(x))/length(x) * 100 }
missing <- apply(notypos, 1, percentmiss)
table(missing)
```

## Replacing Missing Data: Rows

- Create a set of rows to potentially replace.
- If you know you want to include participants *pairwise*, you can also create a set of participants who you will not replace but keep with the dataset. 

```{r}
replace_rows <- subset(notypos, missing <= 5) #5%
noreplace_rows <- subset(notypos, missing > 5)

nrow(notypos)
nrow(replace_rows)
nrow(noreplace_rows)
```

## Replacing Missing Data: Columns

- Next, we should examine missing data by columns to ensure we do not have **MNAR** data. 
- **Note**: We should examine for this missing data on our `replace_rows` because excluding the incomplete data may eliminate any issues by column. 

```{r}
apply(replace_rows, 2, percentmiss)
```

## Replacing Missing Data: Columns

- Now we will exclude columns that we should not replace missing data for (categorical or demographic data).
- Sex, Age, SES, and Grade are our demographic variables, but you can include variables that do not have missing data to provide a better estimation for the other missing data as `mice` uses all available information to estimate. 

```{r}
replace_columns <- replace_rows[ , -c(1,2,4)]
noreplace_columns <- replace_rows[ , c(1,2,4)] #notice these are both replace_rows
```

## Replacing Missing Data: Using `mice`

- `mice()` will figure out the type of data based on the column structure and replace it with that type of data.
- This function creates several imputations of the data, which we will need to combine back into our original dataset. 

```{r}
library(mice)
temp_no_miss <- mice(replace_columns)
```

## Replacing Missing Data: Using `mice`

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nomiss <- complete(temp_no_miss, 1) #pick a dataset 1-5 

#combine back together
dim(notypos) #original data from previous step
dim(nomiss) #replaced data

#get all columns 
all_columns <- cbind(noreplace_columns, nomiss)
dim(all_columns)

#get all rows
all_rows <- rbind(noreplace_rows, all_columns)
dim(all_rows)
```

## Outliers

- **Definition** - case with extreme value on one variable or multiple variables.

- Why does an outlier occur? 

    - Data input error.
    - "Mindless" participant.
    - Not a population you meant to sample.
    - From the population but has really long tails and very extreme values.
    
- The logic of removing outliers: 

    - Many statistics focus on the mean as a model of the data.
    - The mean is affected by outliers. 
    - We will use a strict criterion to only remove very extreme scores. 

## Outliers: Types

- There are two (2) types:

    - **Univariate** - when you have one (1) DV or Y variable. 
    
        - We can use *Z*-scores with an $\alpha$ of .001 to eliminate very extreme values. 
        - This corresponds to a *Z*-score of +/- 3.
        - This analysis is useful when you only have one column to check. 
        
    - **Multivariate** - when you have multiple continuous variables, measurements, or dependent variables. 
    
        - How can we measure distance for many variables at once?
        - **Mahalanobis distance:** It creates a distance from the centroid (the mean of the means).
        - However, because we are creating a scores based on multiple columns, there is not one rule like *Z*-scores. 
        
## Outliers: Mahalanobis

- Mahalanobis distance is distributed using a $\chi^2$ distribution.
- This measure is a distance measure:
  
    - Distances are always positive!
    - Many scores are close to zero, indicating they are close to the mean of means.
    - Few scores are very large, indicating their scores are very different from everyone else.
    - This type of pattern is not normally distributed, but rather, $\chi^2$.
    
- How do we know what is very far away?

    - Use a $\chi^2$ distribution with *df* = to the number of variables used to create the score. 
    - Use $\alpha$ < .001, as our very strict criterion. 

- Again, because we save multiple datasets, we can test the analysis with and without outliers to help us determine their impact on our analyses. 

## Outliers: Analyze and Eliminate

- All variables must be numbers for this analysis, because we are calculating the mean of means.
- You could also only analyze for outliers on the data that is provided by participants. 
- This stage will potentially eliminate all participants who have any remaining missing data because they will not receive a distance score. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## you can use all columns or all rows here
## however, all rows has missing data, which will not get a score 
str(all_columns)
mahal <- mahalanobis(all_columns[ , -c(1,4)],
                    colMeans(all_columns[ , -c(1,4)], na.rm=TRUE),
                    cov(all_columns[ , -c(1,4)], use ="pairwise.complete.obs"))
```

## Outliers: Analyze and Eliminate

```{r}
## remember to match the number of columns
cutoff <- qchisq(1-.001, ncol(all_columns[ , -c(1,4)]))

## df and cutoff
ncol(all_columns[ , -c(1,4)])
cutoff

##how many outliers? Look at FALSE
summary(mahal < cutoff)

## eliminate
noout <- subset(all_columns, mahal < cutoff)
dim(all_columns)
dim(noout)
```
