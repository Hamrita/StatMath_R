## What is a Correlation?

- **Definition:** It is a way of measuring the extent to which two variables are related.
- Correlation indicates the direction and strength of the relationship across variables. 

    - Direction: none, positive, negative
    - Strength: none (0) to perfect (1 or -1)

## Visualizing Correlation

- No relationship

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/correl/1.png")
```

## Visualizing Correlation

- Positive relationship

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/correl/2.png")
```

## Visualizing Correlation

- Negative relationship

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/correl/3.png")
```

## Using Scatterplots 

- **Plotting reminder:**

- ggplot(data, aes(X, Y, color/fill = categorical)

    - ,+ cleanup coding
    - ,+ geom_point() to get the dots
    - ,+ geom_smooth() to get a line
    - ,+ xlab/ylab

- We can additionally control the length of the X and Y axes with `coord_cartesian()`.

    - coord_cartesian(xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL)
    - coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,101))

## Using Scatterplots

```{r}
library(rio)
library(ggplot2)
cleanup <- theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
                panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
                panel.background = element_blank(), 
                axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black"),
                axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black"),
                legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white"),
                text = element_text(size = 15))
exam <- import("data/exam_data.csv")
liar <- import("data/liar_data.csv")
```

## Using Scatterplots

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#from chapter 5 notes
scatter <- ggplot(exam, aes(Anxiety, Exam))
scatter +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Anxiety Score") +
  ylab("Exam Score") +
  cleanup
```

## Using Scatterplots

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#from chapter 5 notes + coord_cartesian
scatter <- ggplot(exam, aes(Anxiety, Exam))
scatter +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Anxiety Score") +
  ylab("Exam Score") +
  cleanup + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50,100), ylim = c(0,100))
  #just example numbers, you would want to use the real scale of the data
```

## Modeling Relationships

- Remember, our all-in-one statistical equation:
  
    - $Outcome_i = Model + Error_i$

- We have previously defined our model as the Mean and the Standard Deviation or Standard Error.
- We used the SE to determine if our model "fit" well. 

## Modeling Relationships

- Now, we can use:

  - $Outcome_i = \beta X_i + Error_i$

- Correlation is a type of simple standardized regression, which is what this equation represents.
- When you have one X and one Y variable, *r* and $\beta$ are equal. 
- Now we are using *r* or $\beta$ to determine the strength of the model.
- Traditionally you don't see the error values reported (sometimes you see CI).
    
## Measuring Relationships

- How do we measure the direction and strength of the relationship of variables? 
- We need to see whether as one variable increases, the other increases, decreases or stays the same.
- This relationship can be found by calculating the covariance.

    - We look at how much each score deviates from the mean.
    - If both variables deviate from the mean by the same amount, they are likely to be related.

## Revision of Variance

- The **variance** tells us by how much scores deviate from the mean for a single variable.
- We also described the variance as the sum of squares divided by degrees of freedom.

$$SD^2 = \frac {\sum(X_i-\bar{X})^2}{N-1}$$

- Or we could write it like this:

$$SD^2 = \frac {\sum(X_i-\bar{X})(X_i-\bar{X})}{N-1}$$

## Revision of Variance

- **Covariance** is similar - it tells is by how much scores on two variables differ from their respective means.

$$Cov(x,y) = \frac {\sum(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{N-1} $$

## Revision of Variance: Calculating Variance 

```{r}
var(exam$Revise)
var(exam$Exam)
```

## Revision of Variance: Calculating Covariance

```{r}
cov(exam$Revise, exam$Exam)
plot(exam$Revise, exam$Exam)
```

## Problems with Covariance

- It depends upon the units of measurement.
- One solution: standardize it!

    - Divide by the standard deviations of both variables.

- The standardized version of covariance is known as the correlation coefficient.

    - It is relatively unaffected by units of measurement.

## The Correlation Coefficient

$$r = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{S_xS_y}$$

$$r = \frac{\sum(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{(N-1)S_xS_y} $$

- We can just look at *r* to determine the strength of relationship.
- We can also calculate the confidence interval or standard error for *r*. It has traditionally not been quite as popular because of the annoyance of calculating it. *R* makes this easy!
- We can use this confidence interval to assess model fit. 

## The Correlation Coefficient

- It varies between -1 and +1

    - 0 = no relationship

- It is an effect size

    - .1 = small effect
    - .3 = medium effect
    - .5 = large effect
    - Remember, that these are guidelines.

## The Correlation Coefficient
    
- Coefficient of determination, $r^2$

    - By squaring the value of *r* you get the proportion of variance in one variable shared by the other.

## R versus r

- $R$ = correlation coefficient for 3+ variables (you will see this in the regression chapter).
- $r$ = correlation coefficient for 2 variables.
- $r^2$ = coefficient of determination for 2 variables.
- $R^2$ = coefficient of determination for 3+ variables.
- In reality, we often use $R^2$ for anything effect size related, even if it's only 2.

## Correlation: Example

- The correlation between exam revisions and exam anxiety is **positive** and **medium**. 

```{r}
cor(exam$Revise, exam$Exam)
```

## Correlation: Example

- Correlation is an effect size and can be used for statistical testing. What should I check for data screening? 

    - Accuracy
    - Missing (pairwise exclusion may be useful)
    - Outliers
    - Normality
    - Linearity
    - Homogeneity
    - Homoscedasticity

## Correlation: Understanding the NHST

- Remember that we discussed NHST as a framework for understanding the results of a statistical test. 
- For correlation, we might consider using:

    - H0: The correlation between exam performance and exam revisions is zero. 
    - H1: The correlation between exam performance and exam revisions is not zero. 

## Correlation: Understanding the NHST

- We can use many different forms of this type of set up:

    - H0: The correlation between exam performance and exam revisions is less than .1 
    - H1: The correlation between exam performance and exam revisions is greater than .1
    
## Correlation: Understanding the NHST
    
- The main "rule" is that the two hypotheses are opposites and cover the entire range of possibilities. For example, here's an incompatible set up:

    - H0: The correlation between exam performance and exam revisions is zero.  
    - H1: The correlation between exam performance and exam revisions is greater than .1
    - What do you do if the relationship is negative? 
  
## Correlation: How to Calculate

- We've already used `cor()` during data screening. 
- But what about *p* values for our statistical test? What does a *p* value tell us again?
- Also, what about confidence intervals and other types of correlation? 

## Correlation: How to Calculate

- **cor() function will calculate:** 
    
    - Pearson, Spearman, Kendall
    - Multiple correlations at once
    - No p-values 
    - No confidence intervals 
    
## Correlation: How to Calculate

- Note: here we have gender as a numeric value, we will come back to that issue in a little bit. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cor(exam[ , -1], 
    use="pairwise.complete.obs", 
    method = "pearson")

cor(exam[ , -1], 
    use="pairwise.complete.obs", 
    method = "kendall")
```

## Correlation: How to Calculate

- **rcorr() function will calculate:**

    - Pearson, Spearman
    - Multiple correlations at once
    - Includes p values
    - No confidence intervals

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Hmisc)
rcorr(as.matrix(exam[ , -1]), type = "pearson")
```

## Correlation: How to Calculate

- **cor.test() function will calculate:**

    - Pearson, Spearman, Kendall
    - One correlation at a time
    - Includes p values
    - Include the confidence interval 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cor.test(exam$Revise,
         exam$Exam,
         method = "pearson")
```

## Correlation Interpretation

- **The third-variable problem:**

    - In any correlation, causality between two variables cannot be assumed because there may be other measured or unmeasured variables that potentially affect the results.

- **Direction of causality:**

    - Correlation coefficients say nothing about which variable causes the other to change.

## Nonparametric Correlation

- **Spearman's Rho**: Pearson's correlation on the ranked data.
- **Kendall's Tau**: A different version of Spearman's that handles small samples and tied ranks better. 

## Correlation: Example

- Dataset consisting of the World's Best Liar Competition:

    - 68 contestants
    - Measures
    
        - Where they were placed in the competition (first, second, third, etc.)
        - Creativity questionnaire (maximum score 60)
        - If they had competed in the competition before

```{r}
str(liar)
```

## Correlation: Example

- Because this dataset has true ordinal data (first, second, etc.), the non-parametric statistics are more appropriate. 

- **Spearman**

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
with(liar, cor.test(Creativity, Position, method = "spearman"))
```

- **Kendall**

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
with(liar, cor.test(Creativity, Position, method = "kendall"))
```

## Correlation: Example

- All values must be numeric to be able to do any of these correlations.
- Therefore, if you have any variables that import with labels, you will have defactor them using `as.numeric()`.
- What type of correlation should we use with **binary** predictors? 

    - When using correlation on binary outcomes, you are essentially creating a standardized difference between the group means.
    - *t*-tests will give you equivalent answers and may be more interpretable. 

## Correlation: Biserial

- Point or Point Biserial is correlation a binary variable.
- Which is which?

    - Point Biserial = true dichotomy, no underlying continuum
    - Biserial = not quite discrete but has been split like pass/fail 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
liar$Novice2 <- as.numeric(as.factor(liar$Novice))
str(liar) #we had to factor because of the character variable
with(liar, cor.test(Creativity, Novice2))
plot(liar$Creativity, liar$Novice2)
```

## Comparing Correlations

- How can I tell if these two correlation coefficients are significantly different?

    - Install package **cocor** to be able to compare them!

- **First,** you have to decide if the correlations are independent or dependent

    - **Independent correlations**: the correlations come from separate groups of people, but are on the same variables
    - **Dependent correlation**: the correlations are from the same people, but are different variables (overlapping or not)

## Independent Correlations

- There's no split/subset function within cocor.
- Therefore, you have to split up the dataset on your independent variable, and then put it back together in `list` format.
- Subset the data, then create a list.

    - cocor(~ X + Y | X + Y, data = data)
    - Fill in X and Y with your variables you want to correlate (on these they are likely to be the same).
    - Data = new list we just created. 
    
## Independent Correlations

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(cocor)
new <- subset(liar, Novice == "First Time")
old <- subset(liar, Novice == "Had entered Competition Before")
ind_data <- list(new, old)
cocor(~Creativity + Position | Creativity + Position,
      data = ind_data)
```

## Dependent Correlations

- `cocor(~ X + Y | Y + Z, data = data)` - Overlapping correlation
- Fill in X, Y, Z with your variables you want to correlate
- You can also have `X + Y | Q + Z` - Non-overlapping correlation
- Data is the dataframe with all of the columns

## Dependent Correlations

```{r}
cocor(~Revise + Exam | Revise + Anxiety, 
      data = exam)
```

## Partial and Semi-Partial Correlations

- **Partial correlation:**

    - Measures the relationship between two variables, controlling for the effect that a third variable has on them both.

- **Semi-partial correlation:**

    - Measures the relationship between two variables controlling for the effect that a third variable has on only one of the others.

## Partial and Semi-Partial Correlations

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/correl/9.png")
```

## Partial Correlations

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ppcor)
pcor(exam[ , -c(1)], method = "pearson")
```

## Semipartial Correlations

- Notice how the top and bottom half of the correlation matrix are not equal. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
spcor(exam[ , -c(1)], method = "pearson")
```

## Summary

- What have we learned?

    - There are way more correlations than just Pearson
    - We can compare correlations
    - We can somewhat control for the third variable problem with partial and semi-partial correlations
    - Correlation more than an effect size
